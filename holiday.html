                  Overview
                </h3>
                <p>
                    2022 has been a wonderful year for the Sennett clan. 2021 was full of change and gratefulness. In 2022, we have stayed incredibly grateful for all of the great things in our lives. We had a much more consistent year this year. No big moves or career changes. Our biggest change was changing schools for Max. You can read all about that on Max's page!
                </p>
                <p> 
                    2022 has been all about consistency with periods of great adventures. We have hit a rhythm this calendar year. We go to school/work, head to athletic practices and games, spend time outside, and spend time together. We are so grateful for the time we are able to spend with each other (even if we don't show it sometimes).

                  California Adventures
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We had some incredible adventures this year. We took a Wilkie family trip to California in August. We packed in as many cool activities as we could while we were on the west coast. We spent a few days at Disneyland with our expert tour guides, Matt and Grace. We ate all of the snacks and rode all of the big rides. Lee and Max both loved riding Space Mountain. I think Nicole and I preferred the Radiator Springs Racers in Cars World the most. The kids built lightsabers and R2 unit droids with their Uncle Matt. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We didn't spend all of our time at Dineyland though. We were lucky enough to spend a day at the beach in Santa Monica. This was one of Zach's favorite parts of the trip. It was his first time seeing the Pacific Ocean. We walked along Muscle Beach and the Santa Monica pier. We also spent a day at the aquarium in Long Beach hanging out with sharks and penguins!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The coolest part of the trip was visiting the production offices for Disney and Marvel Studios in Burbank. Matt showed us all of the cool movie props and memorabilia from the first 4 phases of the MCU. We held Cap's shield, petted some of Thor's goats, and saw all of the iterations of Iron Man's suits. It was so cool to see all of this up close. It was even better to see Uncle Matt's dreams coming true!

                  Ocean Isle and Hurricane Ian
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We took small trip to Ocean Isle at the end of September. That also cooincided with Hurricane Ian making its way up the east coast. We can cross weathering out a tropical storm at the beach off of our bucket list. When the weather cleared, we had an amazing time playing and relaxing on the beach. It was so much fun to watch the boys run and play and have a great time. Once we win that lottery, we'll be buying a spot on the beach in Ocean Isle.

                  Visiting the Susquehanna Valley

                <p>
                    Our family was able to travel north to see Oma and Steve-O for a few days at the end of June. We spent some time splashing around in the pool and eating all of the great food that Central Pennsylvania has to offer. The kids wrestled around with Steve-O and snuggled with Oma every chance they could. They have so much love for each other and we are so thankful for the special relationship they have.

                    We are so grateful for the opportunities we have been given this year. We are thankful for the love and support we get from family and friends. We cannot wait to see what new things are on the horizon in 2023!
