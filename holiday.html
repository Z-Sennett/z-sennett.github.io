                    Two words have defined 2021 for the Sennett Family in 2021: Gratefulness and Change. We started off the year hunkered down trying to do our part to stop the spread of the pandemic. We also settled into our new house. Huckleberry Loop has become home over the past 12+ months and we have definitely made this place our own. We are so thankful that we have found a place that we can call home for many years to come.
