                The Sennetts' Year In Review
            </h1>
                <p>
                    2021 has been a wild ride for us in the Sennett household. Every day has been a new adventure. Two words have defined our family this year: <strong>Change</strong> and <strong>gratefulness</strong>. Here are some of the highlights of our 2021.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    We spent the beginning of 2021 settling into our new home. We moved to South Mebane in November of 2020. We loved our old neighborhood, but we had outgrown our first house. Our new place is in a neighborhood with more young families. We have a backyard with a fence (a must if you know Max). I can see the baseball fields at the Mebane Rec Complex out of my window as I am writing this. We have spent the last year making this home our own. Lee and Max's pictures are all over the place. We are so thankful to have found a place to put down roots for a lot of years. Having access to a pool on those 100 degree North Carolina days doesn't hurt either!

                    We had an eventful summer. The four of us were able to take a trip to Boone for a weekend in August. We did lots of Boone things. We went hiking on some of the beautiful trails. We visited Tweetsie Railroad and got to ride all of the fun rides. We hit up downtown Blowing Rock and had some tasty treats from Kilwins. We capped it all off with a visit to the Mast General Store. Nicole and I are hopeful that the boys may want to go to Appalachian State when they get older so we will have lots of reasons to spend time there.

                    We were lucky to get to spend a couple days in Wrightsville Beach with Zach's parents. The boys had so much fun running around and playing on the beach. They would stay there forever if we let them. Max was in his glory digging in the sand and sitting in the tide. Lee spent every second he could in the water trying to swim in the waves. We are so thankful we could do this with Steve and Ruth.

                    Speaking of Zach's parents, we were finally able to get back to central Pennsylvania after nearly a year for some time this summer. The boys spent every minute they could in Oma's pool. We got to visit with grandparents and cousins and eat all of the food we miss so much. We are so excited to go back up over the Christmas holiday and see family and friends.

                    Nicole and Zach celebrated their 10th anniversary this year. We had big plans to visit a tropical locale and sip fruity drinks for a while but the pandemic put a damper on that. Luckily, we were able to steal a weekend away and travel to New York City to see the musical "Waitress". We had a great time walking around Manhatten and seeing all of the sites. We visited every bakery we could and spent far too much time in flagship stores for brands aimed at our kids. It was amazing to get away for a short time and to see a Broadway Show.

                <p>
                    2021 was the year of change for us. We settled into our new house. Nicole took a new job at a school in Burlington, NC. Zach took a new job teaching at a new online school and is working from home. Lee changed schools in November and is navigating a new school in a place where people haven't known him since he was conceived. Max has started to come into his own with one of the most unique personalities you'll ever meet.

                    We are so grateful for the opportunities we have been given this year. We are thankful for the love and support we get from family and friends. We cannot wait to see what new things are on the horizon in 2022!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Happy Holidays!
