                  Overview
                </h3>
                <p>
                    2023 was a busy year for the Sennetts. Nicole and Zach went to California for a few days in February. Max started Kindergarten. Lee joined a competitive soccer league. We also took more trips with family. It has been a wonderful year for us.
                </p>

                  California Adventures Part II
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Nicole and Zach had the wonderful opportunity to attend the Ant-Man: Quantumania premier in Los Angeles with Matt and Grace. Nicole met Paul Rudd. Zach dropped some straws on Alice Cooper's head. We sat next to Bill Murray and Chidi from "The Good Place". It was a pretty surreal experience. Nicole and Zach got to experience Disneyland sans kids and enjoy an amazing Japanese meal atop the Hollywood Hills. It was a wonderful few days. Special thanks to Matt and Grace for hosting us!

                <h3>
                  Myrtle Beach With Oma, Steve-O, and Courtney
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We were so lucky to spend a week in North Myrtle Beach with the Sennett clan. It was sunny, hot, and full of love. The Max and Lee played in the ocean and soaked up the sun. We spent a lot of hours in the pool and cooked a seafood feast like no other. We are always so thankful to create memories with people we love.
                </p>

                  Boone
                </h3>
                <p>
                  We spent a wonderful long weekend in Boone during the summer. We visited Tweetsie Railroad and mined for gems. We relaxed in a hot tub with a wonderful view from atop a mountain. It was a beautiful experience for us to spend time together. The rain put a damper on a lot of our planned outdoor activities, but we made the best of it!

                  Wilkie Beack Trip
                </h3>
                <p>
                  If we hadn't traveled enough, we were lucky to get the chance to spend a weekend along the coast of North Carolina in October with Stephanie and Tony. We played in the sand and walked along the beach. The water was cold and choppy, but Oak Island was quiet and peaceful. The boys demonstrated they were hot tub pros and loved relaxing in the jets. We are so grateful that we get to spend quality time with Stephanie and Tony!
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Visiting the Susquehanna Valley
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our family was able to travel north to see Oma and Steve-O for a few days in the beginning of August. We spent some time splashing around in the pool and eating all of the great food that Central Pennsylvania has to offer. We even snuck in a quick trip to Knoebels before our day was cut short by tornado warnings. The kids wrestled around with Steve-O and snuggled with Oma every chance they could. They have so much love for each other and we are so thankful for the special relationship they have. Zach and Nicole attended Zach's 20th class reunion. They got to catch up with old friends and have a wonderful time. We are heading back up for Christmas and can hopefully spend more time up north this summer.
                </p>
