        <h1>Purpose of This Page</h1>
          <p>
            I'd like to use this page as a place to <strong>experiment</strong> with new HTML concepts and ideas. I'm learning more and more each day and no project is ever finished. For me, the best way to learn new things and to move forward is to throw it all against the wall and see what sticks. This page will be the lab. What works will eventually be put into place in my other pages. Having a chronology of my experience learning Web Development seems appealing to me.
          </p>
          <p>Two weeks from now, this could all change. Don't hold me to it!</p>
          
          <h2>Closing Up This School Year</h2>
            <p>
              To say that this particular academic year was the hardest of my entire career would be an understatement. This academic year covered, in no particular order:
              <ul>
                <li>Moving to 1:1 in the matter of 6 weeks </li>
                <li>Distributing in the ballpark of 900 devices in less than a week</li>
                <li>Preparing a staff of 150 to use a completely new LMS</li>
                <li>A complete migration of Single Sign On from one service to another</li>
                <li>Around 300 tickets and counting for damaged devices</li>
                <li>Developing a plan for in-person instruction in less than a month</li>
                <li>Transitioning back to a school full of humans</li>
                <li>Adapting outdated display technologies to integrate with 3 screens, underpowered devices, and crazy workloads</li>
                <li>Completing two graduate courses</li>
                <li>Preparing to receive in the ballpark of 900 devices for inventory and repair</li>
                <li>And a million other things along the way</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              I cannot wait for a brief repreive in a few weeks. There are a few books on my reading list and a sizeable chunk of projects at home to work through. It is going to be glorious!
            </p>

        <h2>
          Things Change Quickly
        </h2>
          <p>
            I'm in the 10th week or so of my web development class and I feel like I've forgotten a lot of the first bit of HTML we covered. I wanted to brush up a bit more on HTML style so I thought it was the perfect opportunity to goof around on the Blog page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process of learning web development in my mid-thirties after spending my entire adult life in elementary classrooms has been a challenge. When I really think about it, devoting brain space to learning new concepts at this point in my life with a full-time job, spouse, two young children, and a pandemic winding down is next to impossible. So here I am doing what I can to try to learn something incredibly complex.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all of that being said. I'm happy I'm trying something new. Everything is always changing around us and I need to be more adaptable. I've always been pretty routine oriented and stuck in my ways. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(very poorly I might add) has forced me to think in new ways. I don't know that I'll ever be an expert in any of it. That's not the point though. I just can't be stagnant and coast through knowing what I know. I have to keep changing how I think and how I do things along with everything else that is changing around me. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My next step is going to be looking at how to nest pages in folders and to create sidebar nav elements. It is amazing to think that after 10 weeks I have enough content on these pages to think about reorganizing everything into a different structure. Let's see how this goes!
