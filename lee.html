                Lee's Year In Review
            </h1>
                <p>
                    Lee has had an action packed year in 2021. He started the year in remote learning and transitioned back into the physical classroom in March. Lee loves to read. His current favorite books are the Gregor the Overlander Series, the Tristan Strong series, 13-Story Treehouse series, Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, graphic novels, and any science non-fiction he can get his hands on. We always get a chuckle when we see him reading in awkward positions. Mostly, we're just grateful that he loves reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lee loves to be outside and to play with his friends. He has started to spread his wings a bit and play with kids in the neighborhood on his own. He is becoming more and more independent. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lee has really come into his own on the soccer field. He discovered that there are defensive positions on the soccer pitch. He started playing sweeper on his fall soccer team. He has done such a good job and has grown so much. He has started to understand how to take angles to get to the ball. He has also figured out how to clear the ball into space or to an open teammate. He's still working on understanding that he won't score many goals this way. However, he is helping his team and is an important part of helping his team get better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lee also started playing team basketball this fall. We are only a couple weeks into the season and he is doing his best to learn how to get better. He is doing a great job of learning how to dribble. He is also learning how to move around in space without the ball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lee discovered video games in earnest this year. He has become a pro in all things Nintendo Switch. He especially likes racing games and anything related to Super Mario. He dominates in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and enjoys bouncing around in Super Mario 3D World/Bowser's Fury.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2021 brought about a lot of changes for Lee. He started at a new school the week of Thanksgiving. Forest View was our home for a long time and he was sad to leave. He has found a great new home in South Mebane. He really likes that he doesn't have a 45-minute commute to school each day. He is also really excited to start riding the bus home each afternoon. He has been such a good sport amidst all of this change. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are so proud of Lee and the person he is becoming. We can't wait to see what he does in 2022. If 2021 is any indication, he will grow by leaps and bounds.
