                <h2>
                  Lee's Highlights!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lee had a wonderful 2023! Here is a look at Lee throughout the year:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lee started 4th-grade this year. He continues to read everything he can get his hands on. He especially loves Mythology and all of the installments in the Rick Riordan Series. Lee is very involved with school activities. He is participating in the Science Olympiad for his school as well as editing the school news. He has also joined the Rubiks Cube club. We couldn't be happier with the interest he has shown for a diversity of school activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lee has completely caught the football fever. Not that football. Soccer is his first love. He joined the Academy Club with MYSA. We spend most of our fall running him to practices and games. He is improving by leaps and bounds. He has found a great team to be a part of. He is currently playing winter soccer on Saturdays and will resume his Academy season in the spring. He comes home and checks out the daily recaps of the English Premiership League each day and loves supporting Manchester City. It has been so much fun to watch him grow.
                </p>
                <p>Lee played his first season of baseball in the spring. He really excelled at the plate and in middle infield. He decided to get more involved with soccer, so he won't play again this spring. He may decide to play again in the future. You never can tell with him!</p>
                <p>
                  Lee has become a lot more social this year. He likes to run around the neighborhood with other kids from his school. He is slowly creeping his way into his tweens and becoming more independent. It's hard to believe he will turn 10 in June and head to 5th-grade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2023 was an amzing year for Lee. He has continued to mature and grow into an incredible human. He is smart and funny and caring and all around amazing. I think we'll keep him around.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can't wait to see what awaits Lee in 2024!
                </p>
