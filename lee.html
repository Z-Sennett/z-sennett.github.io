                <h2>
                  Lee's Highlights!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lee is crushing it in 2022. Here is a look at Lee throughout the year:
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lee started 3rd-grade this year. He is an avid reader and a math facts master. He has read Harry Potter books 1 and 2. He is also reading Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. He likes listening to podcasts about mythology and science. He has grown so much this year. His questions require me to Google something more and more frequently.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lee is super active. Like, he can't sit still. He loves being outside and playing with his friends in the neighborhood. They spend time exploring the "woods" near our house. His friends ring the doorbell as soon as he gets off the bus. We're not complaining though. It's a good problem to have.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lee has kept very busy with sports. He finished his fall soccer season in the middle of November. He continues to get better and better. This season was a little tough because it was a big jump to a larger field, larger goal, and older kids. He played very well this year on the defensive end and as keeper. Lee is avidly following the USMNT in the World Cup. He has also picked his favorite Premiership team. I guess we support Manchester City in our house now!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lee just started his second basketball season. He has improved so much since last year. Even his coach was taken aback by how much better he has gotten. We can look forward to Lee playing a little Point Guard this season. It has been really fun to see him grow!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lee wants to give baseball a go in the spring. Zach is excited to coach a sport he actually knows about. Here's to hoping everything goes well!
                </p>
                <p>
                  2022 was great for Lee. He has come into his own as an individual. He continues to become more independent. He definitely has his own personality. He's still growing in every way. He grew over 4 inches in the last year. At this rate, he'll be the tallest one in the house by the time he gets to middle school!
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can't wait to see what awaits Lee in 2023!
                </p>
