        <h1>A Snapshot Of My Work</h1>
        <p>The goal of this page is to provide a space to share some of the work I've done as a teacher and as an Instructional Technology Leader. Some of the work you will find here was done as part of my graduate work in the Learning Design and Technology program and North Carolina State University. Some of the other things you will find here have been collected from my experience in the classroom and working with other teachers.</p>
