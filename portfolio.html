        <h1>A Snapshot Of My Work</h1>
        <p>The goal of this page is to provide a space to share some of the work I've done as a teacher and as an Instructional Technology Leader. Some of the work you will find here was done as part of my graduate work in the Learning Design and Technology program and North Carolina State University. Some of the other things you will find here have been collected from my experience in the classroom and working with other teachers.</p>

        <h2>Using FlipGrid In Elementary Content Areas</h2>
        <p>This is a training video I created for an introductory course in my graduate program. This video focuses on the FlipGrid platform and how it can be used to support all content areas at the K-5 level. The video gives a few lesson ideas and walks teachers through how to integrate this tool into everyday instruction. I used the ScreenCastify tool to record and edit the video.</p>

        <h2>Security Practices 101 For Teachers</h2>

            <p>This item is a presentation I put together for a class in my graduate program. It is the skeleton of a Web Security presentation to be presented to school staff. I developed it in response to a rash of RansomWare incidents that were happening to organizations in the county I work in. I presented it to the staff I work with in February of 2019. </p>

        <h2>Modern Classroom Design</h2>

            <p>This artifact is a link to a Modern Classroom design project I put together. I researched different classroom design principles and used the dimensions of a classroom at the school I was working at to design a classroom. I designed this right before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and flexible use philosophies informed the design. Seating is interchangeable and suits small and large group instruction. I also included an itemized list for furniture and other classroom needs. </p>
