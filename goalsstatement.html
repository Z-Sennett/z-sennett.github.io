          Goals Statement
      </h1>
      <p>
        I chose to enter the Learning Design and Technology program in the fall of 2018 to pursue a career as an Instructional Technology Facilitator in a K-12 setting in North Carolina Public Schools. I believe I have mastered the many skills needed to be an Instructional Technology Facilitator through my work in this program and my previous work experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instructional Technology Facilitators (ITFs) have a variety of different responsibilities that vary from one organization to another. ITFs must be knowledgeable of the platforms and systems that are utilized by their organizations. They are usually the point person in their school for teacher questions about instructional technology and how to best implement instructional technology in a classroom setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        ITFs are instructional leaders and they are responsible for much of the training and professional development schools provide to educators in instructional technology. Providing training and professional development can take many forms. ITFs provide knowledge repositories to aid educators in finding relevant information. They also provide asynchronous learning opportunities like graphic aids and videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back at my working experience in the field of Instructional Technology and my experiences in the Learning Design and Technology program, I can confidently say that I am capable of fulfilling all of the responsibilities that come with serving as an Instructional Technology Facilitator.
      </p>

      <h2>
          Leading Professional Learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        Instructional Technology Facilitators are important leaders in professional learning at the school and organizational level. They are responsible for introducing new instructional technology initiatives to teachers. ITFs are also responsible for helping teachers to combine pedagogical practices with appropriate instructional technology tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        An artifact that exemplifies this goal is the video “Using FlipGrid in Elementary Content Areas”. I created this video to showcase ways FlipGrid can be used as a tool in multiple content areas. It provides ideas for integration into core content areas and instructions for how to set it up and get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        This artifact shows that I can create engaging content that helps teachers find ways to integrate instructional technology into existing pedagogical practices.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Designing Physical Learning Environments
      </h2>
      <p>
        Instructional Technology Facilitators assist teachers in designing appropriate learning environments. The artifact “Modern Classroom Design Project” is an example for designing learning spaces to fit the needs of learners, instruction, and the physical environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are often physical barriers to designing well thought out learning environments. Being able to offer concrete suggestions and examples of learning environment designs for teachers to use is important to help build credibility, increase trust, and promote teamwork between colleagues.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Providing Support for Instructional Technology Tools and Skills
      </h2>
      <p>
        Instructional Technology Facilitators need to assess deficits in practice and offer support to teachers that need it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teachers must have a firm understanding of what the tools are used for and how to properly use them. The artifact “Google Workspace Professional Development for Beginning Teachers” is an example of how to effectively support teachers. This project instructs beginning teachers in best practices for using many of the tools found in Google Workspace. Google Workspace provides the backbone for most instructional technology programs in K-12 education and beyond.   
      </p>
      <h2>
          Using Video to Support Learning 
      </h2>
      <p>
        As traditional instructional practices shift toward blended learning practices, video as an instructional medium is becoming more important. Instructional Technology Facilitators must have a background with creating engaging video content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The artifact that demonstrates my ability to create engaging video content is a documentary style video titled, “FVE Media Documentary” I created for our school library. All footage, effects, and content were created by me using a video camera and the Adobe Premiere editing software. It serves as an example of how to tell stories that illustrate the importance of an often overlooked space. 
      </p>
      <h2>
          Collaboration and Organizing Information
      </h2>
      <p>
        Working in education, no matter what position, requires collaboration skills. Tasks are oftentimes too large or complex to complete individually. Being able to work together allows educators to tackle larger projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The artifact I chose for collaboration is the “Online Repository” for teachers and staff to help them navigate the various instructional technology platforms our organization uses. I led our Media and Technology Advisory Committee to create this repository leading up to the 2020-2021 school year. Our district remained remote until March of 2021, a full year after the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to move to online instruction. The repository houses video, instructions, screen captures, and directions on how to use many of our instructional technology platforms. The artifact shows my ability to manage a large project in an efficient manner and that I can create organizational tools to house various pieces of information.  
      </p>
      <h2>
          Instructional Technology Policies and Laws
      </h2>
      <p>
        Instructional Technology Facilitators must understand the laws and policies that impact the use of instructional technology in schools. They must also participate in creating policy documents at school and organizational levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The artifact I chose to share to exemplify this skill is a “Responsible Use Policy” I created. A Responsible Use Policy is a document that users must adhere to while using organizational technology assets. This document is a good example of a Responsible Use framework but would need to solicit outside opinions from stakeholders and legal experts.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Educating Adults About Online Safety Practices
      </h2>
      <p>
        In February of 2020, the county I work in fell victim to a massive ransomware attack. Thankfully, it did not impact our school district systems. However, it very easily could have.
      </p>
      <p>
        The artifact I am sharing, “Digital Security 101”, is a professional learning session I created to deliver to staff in response to the increased risk of malware attacks. I was scheduled to deliver this session in April of 2020 however, I was unable to lead it because of the impacts of COVID-19. Nevertheless, I feel it is a good example of my ability to take a very nuanced and complicated problem and break it down into terms that average users are able to comprehend. The most important skill for Instructional Technology Facilitators is often the ability to break down information and present it in a meaningful way for users who are not as familiar with instructional technology concepts.
      </p>
      <h2>
          In Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p>
          Instructional Technology Facilitators need to have a wide range of abilities and expertise. It is important for ITFs to demonstrate they can lead, learn, and seek out answers. ITFs are not required to be masters of any one particular field, rather they must be comfortable in many different roles. The artifacts I am presenting will showcase my ability to do just that.
