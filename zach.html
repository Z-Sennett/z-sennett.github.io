                Zach's Highlights!
              </h2>
                <p>
                    2022 was about consistency and returning to normal for Zach. 2021 was full of changes and 2022 was a nice step back. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zach continues to teach at Ignite Online Academy in Durham Public Schools. He loves the flexibility that teaching at an online school provides. It has given him a chance to sharpen more of his instructional skills and made him a more rounded educator. He also took on more technology responsibilities at Ignite this year. He is managing all of the digital devices for staff and students at his school. Zach finished his graduate degree in Learning Design and Technology from NC State University and is loving being a member of the Ignite team!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zach rediscovered his love for music this year. He has started collecting vinyl records and listens to them any chance he can get. He also started a small business with his friends AJ and Philip. It's called Three Count Records and we sell new and used vinyl records at pop-up markets through the Triangle region of North Carolina. The goal is to blend our love or Pro Wrestling and music to create a community that is open to everyone. We made some progress with creating relationships with local breweries, Indie record labels, and distibutors. We are looking to launch a podcast about our favorite music and wrestling. We would also like to press our first 7 inch record this year! Be on the lookout for TCR-001!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, 2022 was a great year for Zach. It was filled with time with his family, his first visit to the West Coast, starting new projects, and trying to be the best partner he can be.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bring on 2023!
                </p>
