                    The last calendar year has had its share of ups and downs. There have been lots of professional, academic, and personal changes this year. There have been moments offrustration and well as moments of joy. Without the bitter, the sweet just ain't as sweet.

                    I made my assistant coaching debut, at least as a soccer coach, for Lee's team this fall. I freely admit that I know very little about soccer. However, I didn't really need to. Coaching a team of 10 young kids is a challenge. It was a lot of fun getting to work with Lee's team and getting to watch them grow throughout the season.

                    November has been a whirlwind for me. I took a new position at a new school. I am now working from home at an online public school in the same district. I will be working with mostly middle schoolers. We will be working on using technology responsibly to communicate and create. I will also be working with teachers to help them learn more about developing online courses. Leaving FVE was very hard to do. I spent the last 10+ years of my life there. Most of it working in the same building as Nicole and, in recent years, catching glimpses of Lee walking the halls. However, I'm so excited about this next step and what I can build moving forward.

                    I will graduate from NC State with a M.Ed in Learning Design and Technology in the middle of December. I started the program in the fall of 2019. What a time to undertake a massive amount of work, right? Working full-time, being a partner, dad, and going to grad school all while navigating a pandemic has been an enormous challenge. I am thankful it will be finished soon. I am proud of what I've been able to accomplish. I am oh so grateful to Nicole for being so supportive of me throughout it all. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's to hoping for a less tumultuous 2022. I am looking forward to seeing what is in store!
