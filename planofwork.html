        <h1>Graduate Plan of Work</h1>
            <p>
                The Learning Design and Technology graduate program at North Carolina State University incorporates elements of Learning Theory, Instructional Design, Educational Leadership, and Culture through the lens of Instructional Technology. The next section outlines my Graduate Plan of Work.

                <ul>
                    <li>ECI 519: Technology, Media, and Culture (Fall, 2019)<br>
                    The Technology, Media, and Culture course concentrated on using instructional technology to explore culture inside, and outside, of the classroom. This course examined Individualistic and Collectivist cultures and how their culture impacts their world view. We also investigated ways to make learning more culturally responsive by using tools like FlipGrid, Scratch, and Google Tour Builder.
                    </li>
                    <li>ECI 518: Digital Learning and Staff Development (Spring 2020)<br>
                        The Digital Learning and Staff Development course concentrated on skills that are needed to operate as an Instructionl Technology Facilitator in K-12 schools. This course investigated device procurement, classroom design, technology infrastructure, and security. 
                    </li>
                    <li>ECI 512: Emerging Technology for Teaching and Learning (Summer I, 2020)<br>
                        The Emerging Technology for Teaching and Learning course focused on digital technologies that are on the brink of mainstream use. This course spent time studying digital technologies like Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality and how those technologies could be used to expand teaching and learning. A major component of this course was to create a 30-minute instructional video to teach others how to use an emerging technology.
                    </li>
                    <li>ECI 511: Introduction to Learning Design and Technology (Summer II, 2020)<br>
                        The Introduction to Learning Design and Technology was an introductory course to the program. This course served as an orientation for the program as a whole. 
                    </li>
                    <li>ECI 516: Desgining and Evaluating Instructional Materials (Fall, 2020)<br>
                        The Designing and Evaluating Instructional Materials focused on the processes of Instructional Design. This course required students to evaluate Instructional Design plans. The major project of this course was a group project that required students to create an entire Instructional Design project. Groups designed instructional materials, analayzed performance gaps, and went through the entire Instructional Design process.
                    </li>
                    <li>ECI 519: Web Development (Spring, 2021)<br>
                    The Web Development course focused on the fundamentals of creating a working website. This course required students to write websites from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Web Development course also introduced developer tools, accessibility awareness, and principles of creating a great user experience. The final project for this course is this current website. Everything on this site was created from the ground up with the tools I learned during this course.
