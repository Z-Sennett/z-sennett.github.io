        <h2>Music I Love</h2>
        <p> <!--Just playing around and practicing nesting here -->
            I have always been a giant fan of music. I listen to just about everything but, I have a special place in my heart for Punk Rock. Here are a few bands I've been listening to recently:
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Spanish Love Songs</em>- Incredible rock fused with punk. A lot of Springsteen feels for older millenial content. Can't recommend it enough.</li>
                    <li><em>Brass Against</em>- Metal covers with brass instruments and a rotating cast of vocalists. I especially enjoy their <strong>Rage Against the Machine</strong> covers.</li>
                    <li><em>The Dreadnoughts</em>- SeaShanties are all the rage at the moment but, The Dreadnoughts have been doing it a long time. Throw a punk band on a pirate ship for a couple of years and this is what will come out. </li>
                    <li><em>Against Me!</em>- They have been the standard of Punk rock for the past 20 years.</li>
                    <li><em>Alkaline Trio</em>- Storytellers of the highest order. If the show <strong>Dexter</strong> were a band, you'd get Alkaline Trio.</li>
                

                </ol>

        <h2>Books I Love</h2>

                        <li><em>The History of Rome pt. 1</em>- Mike Duncan</li>
                        <li><em>Tristan Strong Punches a Hole in the Sky</em>- Kwame Mbalia</li>
                        <li><em>Percy Jackson Series</em>- Rick Riordan</li>
                        <li><em>Ruby Holler</em>- Sharon Creech</li>
                        <li><em>Norse Mythology</em>- Neil Gaiman</li>
                    
                    </ul>
