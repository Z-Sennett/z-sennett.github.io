        <h2>About Zach</h2>
        <p>
          I am originally from Central Pennsylvania. I graduated from a small university outside of Philadelphia with a degree in <strong>Elementary Education.</strong> I moved to Durham, NC in 2008 and I have been teaching here ever since. I spent my first 10 years in education as a classroom teacher. I moved into a <strong>Technology Facilitator</strong> role in 2018 and I am pursuing a master's degree in Learning Design and Technology at North Carolina State University.       
      </p>
      <p>
          My wife agreed to marry me in 2011 and I'm thankful for her every single day. She is an elementary educator as well and she is probably the best teacher I have ever seen. We have two wonderful children. They are kind, caring, intelligent, and energetic (but, maybe not always in that order).
      </p>
      <p>
          Between parenting two young children, being a 21st-century husband, navigating a pandemic, completing graduate school, and teaching full-time, I don't have a lot of down time. I love music, baseball, pro-wrestling, and ancient history/mythology. 
      </p>
        <h2>Music I Love</h2>
        <p> 
            I have always been a giant fan of music. I listen to just about everything but, I have a special place in my heart for Punk Rock. Here are a few bands I've been listening to recently:
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Spanish Love Songs</em>- Incredible rock fused with punk. A lot of Springsteen feels for older millenial content. Can't recommend it enough.</li>
                    <li><em>Brass Against</em>- Metal covers with brass instruments and a rotating cast of vocalists. I especially enjoy their <strong>Rage Against the Machine</strong> covers.</li>
                    <li><em>The Dreadnoughts</em>- SeaShanties are all the rage at the moment but, The Dreadnoughts have been doing it a long time. Throw a punk band on a pirate ship for a couple of years and this is what will come out. </li>
                    <li><em>Against Me!</em>- They have been the standard of Punk rock for the past 20 years.</li>
                    <li><em>Alkaline Trio</em>- Storytellers of the highest order. If the show <strong>Dexter</strong> were a band, you'd get Alkaline Trio.</li>
                

                </ol>
    
        </p>
        <h2>Books I Love</h2>    
            <p>
                Teachers love books. I am a teacher. These are some of the books I love right now:
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>His Dark Materials</em>- Philip Pullman</li>
                        <li><em>The History of Rome pt. 1</em>- Mike Duncan</li>
                        <li><em>Tristan Strong Punches a Hole in the Sky</em>- Kwame Mbalia</li>
                        <li><em>Percy Jackson Series</em>- Rick Riordan</li>
                        <li><em>Ruby Holler</em>- Sharon Creech</li>
                        <li><em>Norse Mythology</em>- Neil Gaiman</li>
                    
                    </ul>
            </p>
