            Executive Summary
        </h1>
        <p>
            The artifacts I have chosen for my Portfolio were selected to capture the range of skills and responsibilities that are part of being an Instructional Technology Facilitator. Artifacts pertaining to organization, developing instructional materials, video, professional development, and leadership can be found in my Portfolio.  
        </p>
        <h2>
            Professional Learning and Development 
        </h2>
        <p>
            One of my strengths is that I am able to take complex platforms and technological ideas and break them down into more manageable pieces of information for novice users. I have included examples of this in my portfolio. The artifact “FlipGrid in Elementary Content Area” is an example of my ability to create quality instructional materials and provide assistance for integrating an instructional technology platform in core content areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another example of my ability to provide meaningful professional learning opportunities is the “G Suite for Beginning Teachers” artifact. This was a group project that was designed to address the needs of beginning teachers and their use of technology. Undergraduate teacher preparation programs often do not prepare teachers for using technology in the classroom. This artifact provides a module that allows beginning teachers to become familiar with G Suite in small and manageable chunks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, the artifact “Digital Security 101” is an example of my ability to explain complex technology issues to novice users. Many learners, teachers, and users have only a very basic understanding of digital privacy and security. This presentation is meant to be delivered in-person or online in a synchronous setting. It walks participants through Digital Security threats and how to stay safe.
        </p>
    <h2>
        Alternative Mediums and Working With Video
    </h2>
        <p>
            Another strength that is showcased within my artifacts is my ability to use video as a medium of expression and instruction. “FVE Media Documentary” is a video that I created to help showcase a vital and underappreciated department within the school I work for. The video highlights the stories and philosophies of two of our librarians, as well as how the Media Center at our school came to be a bustling hub for the lovers of reading and learning. I was responsible for every element of production for this video and dove head first into learning the Adobe Premier Pro video editing software. The turnaround time was very short for this project. I had less than 10 days to complete it. It could certainly be better. However, I am very proud of the result considering the restraints involved.
        </p>
    <h2>
        Leadership 
    </h2>
        <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic created an educational crisis, the likes of which haven't been seen in over 100 years. In response to a rapid shift to online learning, I led a our MTAC team in the creation of a digital repository for staff to help them navigate the plethora of digital platforms that were available to them. Most staff in our school were new to using instructional technology as the main medium for delivering instruction. The “Staff Repository for Digital Tools” is an example of my ability to lead a team of very capable teachers to create an important and lasting tool.
        </p>
    <h2>
        Policy and Legal Practices
    </h2>
        <p>
            Instructional Technology Facilitators must have a solid understanding of the policies and laws that govern the use of digital technology and students. The artifact “K-5 Responsible Use Policy” is an example of my ability to participate in the development and creation of policy documents. This artifact required me to research existing RUPs from around the country and create a document that can serve as an outline for any organization looking to put a similar policy in place.
        </p>
    <h2>
        Learning New Technology Skills 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Finally, this website itself is an artifact. I have created everything on this website from the ground up. The creation of this website required me to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as how to use hosting tools like GitHub. It has been a painstaking labor to produce something that I am proud of. I constantly work to make it more polished and incorporate new web development concepts I have learned along the way. This artifact shows that I can create a stable and working platform to house information for learning and expression.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        Overall, the artifacts contained in my portfolio paint the picture of a well-rounded individual that is capable of performing the duties of an Instructional Technology Facilitator successfully. Throughout my time in the Learning design and Technology program, I have completed many other projects that are worthy of placement in a portfolio. However, I selected only those that most apply to the role of Instructional Technology Facilitator.
