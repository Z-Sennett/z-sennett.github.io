        <h2>Get to Know Zach</h2>
           <p>
             I am currently a Technology teacher at an elementary school in Durham, North Carolina. I have worked in Durham since 2008. Digital technologies have taken on more and more importance in the classroom since I began teaching. The pace has only quickened since March of 2019.
           </p> 
           <p>
             I didn't start off my career as a Technology Facilitator or Technology Teacher. I fell into it by accident. I started my teaching careeer in 2007. I graduated from <a href= "https://www.arcadia.edu/" target="_blank"> Arcadia University</a>, just north of Philadelphia. I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Elementary Education and I was certified to teach grades K-6.

             I spent the 2007-2008 school year teaching a pre-school class, working as an interventionist, substituting at a nearby school district, and coaching high school baseball. It was hard work and I loved every minute of it. I decided I wanted go somewhere new in the summer of 2008 and applied to places all across the United States and beyond. I was offered a position in Durham, North Carolina, packed up my things, and headed south.
           </p>
           <p>
             My first full-time teaching postion was as a fourth-grade teacher. I was responsible for teaching all core subject areas to classes of 25-35 students. Like any new teacher, I'm sure I learned more in those first few years than my students did. I was fortunate to work in a school with other young teachers. We had to figure everything out for ourselves. During this time, my school became a 1-1 school. Every student and teacher in the school was assigned an iPad. This was in the infancy of 1-1 initiatives and the iPad itself had only debuted a year before. The initiative didn't last long. However, I learned I had a good handle on digital technology and had a better idea of how to use digital technology in my instruction.
           </p>
           <p>
             I took a third-grade position at a different school in 2011. Even though I didn't consider myself an EdTech expert by any definition, my new school was looking to incorporate more technology into their instruction and I found that my previous experience in a 1-1 environment was valuable. Our school didn't have plans to go 1-1, but they were looking at different ways to add more technology effectively.
           </p>
           <p>
             Shortly after I started my new position, we piloted a smart projector initiative in our district. My class was one of the first classrooms in Durham to get a smart projector. I quickly learned the ins and outs of projector set ups and my colleagues started asking me questions any time they had a question or couldn't make something work. I really liked piecing things together and making them work. Projector questions and set ups became one of my unofficial job responsibilites and I was happy to help.
           </p>
           <p>
             Since I had a pretty good grasp for the nuts and bolts of making digital technologies work in the classroom, more and more digital technology things started coming my way. If new printer systems were installed, I created trainings and professional development for how to use the new systems. When our district transitioned to G Suite, I worked with teachers informally to help them learn how to use it. 
           </p>
           <p> 
            I eventually realized that I was doing a lot of the jobs that a Technician or Technology Facilitator would do in addition to my teaching responsibilities. A technology teaching and facilitator position opened up at my school and it made sense for me to transition into that role. I moved out of my classroom in the fall of 2018 and I have been doing this job ever since. I started the Learning Design and Technology graduate program at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">NC State</a> in the fall of 2019 and I hope to finish it in December of 2021.
           </p>
           <p>
             I love working with new technologies and I love teaching. I am very interested in finding ways to help IT departments make digital tools more accessible to students and staff in public schools. IT systems should be secure. They should also provide easy and safe solutions so that all students and staff can access digital tools to expand learning outside of the walls of the school building.
