        <h1>Zach Sennett (Professional)</h1>

        <h2>Get to Know Zach</h2>
            <p>
                I am originally from Central Pennsylvania. I graduated from a small university outside of Philadelphia with a degree in <strong>Elementary Education.</strong> I moved to Durham, NC in 2008 and have been teaching here ever sicne. I spent my first 10 years in education as a classroom teacher. I moved into a <em>Technology Facilitator</em> role in 2018 and I am pursuing a master's degreen in Learning Design and Technology at North Carolina State University.       
            </p>

                My wife agreed to marry me in 2011 and I'm thankful for her every single day. She is an elementary educator as well and she is probably the best teacher I have ever seen. We have two wonderful children. They are kind, caring, intelligent, and energetic (but, maybe not always in that order).
            </p>
            <p>
                Between parenting two young children, being a 21st century husband, navigating a pandemic, completing graduate school, and teaching full-time, I don't have a lot of down time. I love music, baseball, pro-wrestling, and ancient history/mythology.

       <h2>(EdTech)Tools I Love</h2>
            <p>
                There are a million tools out there and 2020 really hammered home the amount of educational tools that are available. Some of the tools I love are digital, and some are not. Here are a few:
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Google Workspace (Formerly G Suite or GAFE</em>- These tools are really the Swiss Army Knife of digital tools. The individual applications and be adapted to fit almost any classroom need. Google Drive Cloud storage makes files accessible anywhere on any device. Google Classroom makes managing assignments incredibly easy.</li>
                        <li><em>FlipGrid</em>- FlipGrid is also a tool that is easily adapted to almost every classroom need. I like using FlipGrid in assoication with <strong>Guided Reading</strong> and <strong>journaling.</strong> Classroom discussions can open up to more voices with FlipGrid. </li>
                        <li><em>Anchor.fm</em>- <a href="https://anchor.fm">Anchor.fm</a></a> is a podcast hosting and publishing service. I always want students to know that they can be <strong>content creators</strong>, not just <strong>content consumers</strong>. If they have thoughts about a book they read, get it out there! Start the conversation. Parents also love to hear about what is happening in the classroom. Podcasts are a great way to get them connected. Anchor.fm makes it easy. </li> 
                        <li><em>Area Model for Multiplication and Divison</em>- This is not a digital tool. Nor is it a new tool. I taught 3rd and 4th-grade math for <strong>10 years</strong> and there is no better tool to help students conceptualize multiplication and division. It teaches students <strong>why</strong> multiplication and division work the way they do using place value and algebraic thinking.</li>
                        <li><em>Animation</em>- It doesn't matter what tool you use, animating concepts promotes higher order thinking skills. I like to use <strong>Google Slides</strong> to animate concepts but there hundreds of other tools. Students must fully understand a concept before they can translate that knowledge to a different medium. Learning the vocabulary to describe the <strong>Water Cycle</strong> takes on a new importance when creating a cartoon for Kindergarten students.</li>
                        <li><em>Dictation</em>- Another tool that can be found in major productivity applications but it is used far too infrequently. <strong>Dictation</strong> allows reluctanct writers and English Language Learners to get their thoughts down on paper without worrying as much about writing/typing. It can be as simple as clicking the microphone button and speaking. I have come to love this tool that is embedded in Office 365 and Google Docs.</li>
                    </ul>
