        <h2>
          Max's Highlights!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Max had one of those years where you turn around and realize he has become a completely new kid. He has gotten so tall and has lost those chunky baby cheeks. Thankfully, he has kept his signature dimples. He is still fierce with everything he does and feels. He has so much love and curiosity it's hard to even describe. Max constantly surprises us with what he is capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
            Max finished preschool at Children's Garden Montessori in June. He learned and grew so much during his time at Children's Garden. We were so sad it was time for him to move on, but move on he did. In a big way! Max started kindergarten in September (super long story). Now, he jumps on the bus with Lee every morning and heads to the big kids' school. He has made some great friends and is excelling at nearly everything. He comes home from school so excited most days. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Max is a sponge. He remembers everything. Max has really taken an interest in maths and numbers. He loves making up addition and subtraction problems with really big numbers to try to stump people around him. He counts to the thousands and even likes to make groups for multiplying. It can be startling to see a kindergartener tell the time on an analogue clock or say that 4 groups of 4 is 16. He does it though and it is fascinating to watch his brain work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Max had a big countdown to his 2,000th day. He asked Alexa (yes, that Alexa) how many days since he was born for close to 100 days straight until she finally told him it had been 2,000 days since he was born. He is very interested in how digital technologies work. He's always asking the smart speaker questions. He loves playing games on the Switch and iPad. He has started trying to figure out how computers work. I suspect he'll release his first app sometime in 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            Max makes everything fun and exciting. He loves making everyone do group hugs. He likes to shout, "Big Brain Crew group hug!" We are so excited to see Max continue to grow in 2024!
