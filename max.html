        <h1>
            Max's Year In Review
        </h1>
        <p>
            If you've ever met Max, you'll know there is no one else like him. He is bright, kind, energetic, and has a mishievous streak a mile long. He Is the first person to try to comfort someone when they are feelin bad. He will freely exclaim I love you to everyone in the family. He can also find just the right thing to push someone's buttons when he doesn't get his way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Max loves his older brother and cannot stand it when he is not allowed to be around him. He loves to chase Lee around the house and play hide-and-go-seek. He always tries to help Lee put together Lego projects. He also love to snuggle up close to Lee whenever he gets the chance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past year, Max has learned all of his letters and colors. He really likes to teach the rest of us all of the shapes he knows. He often asks us what shape he is holding and gives a joyous, "Yeah! You're right! That is a triangle. Good Job!" He also started playing soccer for the first time. He loves to dribble the ball for ten yards and then fall down on top of it. Max is most happy when he is outside with lots of space to run around.
